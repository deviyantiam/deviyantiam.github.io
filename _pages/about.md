Hello!

I'm a Data Scientist with over four years of experience specializing in data analytics, machine learning, deep learning and MLOps. I've worked in different places from consulting firms to dynamic startups, where I've gotten better at what I do and helped with various projects.

Some of cool things I've done include predicting if customers will leave, testing which discount vouchers work best, figuring out credit scores, analyzing sentiments, OCR (extracting text from ID card), monitoring important numbers, designing datawarehouse with Data Vault model.

I'm good at using tools like python, bigquery, tableau. Also know my way around airflow, Rest API, and familiar with GCP. 

Feel free to reach out if you have any position for which you may consider me to be a suitable candidate
